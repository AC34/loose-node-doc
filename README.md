# loose-node-doc
Quick n easy Node.js app document generator.

## ðŸ’¬Anouncement
Everything is under preparation.

Don't use yet.

## How to use
### 1. Installation
Install it as devDependencies.
Type following at your project root.

`npm install loose-node-doc --save-dev`

### 2.Writing genrator script
Create your generator script.
In the script:
  1. require loose-node-doc.
  2. require your app.
  3. set options for loose-node-doc.
  4. then call generate method. 
  5. done

#### API
.generate(app_object,options) : 
  - This method is the only method provided by loose-node-doc.

  Arguments:
  1. target app object (required).    
  2. options (object)

#### Very simple blue print
Your generator script might look like this.

```
//require loose-node-doc before your app.
var lnd = require("loose-node-doc");
var my_app = require("my_app/entry_point");

var options = {
  //using autocompletion
  lnd.options.lang.key:lnd.langs.en.US,

  //you can also type manually
  "some-other-settngs-key":"custom-value"
}

lnd.generate(my_app,options);
//done by this line
```
#### Generating
Run your genrator script.

`node gen-script.js`

done.

### 3.Setting options
You can set various options, see [options page](./OPTIONS.md) for more information.

##### 3.3 Ignoring objects
loose-node-doc tries to find all the necessary paths from the given instance and "require" cache list. This approach simply might include many unnecessary paths.

Ignoring objects can be done by either listing "ignore_paths" and "ignore_objects".
1. Ignoring paths
  - paths are understood as it is from your project root folder(not the OS root).
  - loose-node-doc is automatically removed.
  - You can start the path by blank,"./" or "/".
  - If path is a file, then a file is excluded from the result.
  - If path is a directory, then paths under the directory is excluded from the result.
2. Ignoring by names

 - Names here means object names.

 - Nests are represented by dot.

 - Excludes root object name.

For example, object below 

```
exported_root:{
  name1:{
    name1-1:func1-1(){},
    name1-2:func1-2(){}"
  },
  name2:{}
}
```
is listed as 
```
name1.name1-1
name1.name1-2
name2
```
If you want to exclude func1-1 from output,

` ignore_name:["name1.name1-1"]`

  will do so.

##### 3.4 Choosing language
You may choose language for terminal outputs and logs.
try choosing by 

`[loose-node-doc].lang`

 and autocompletion might help you.

##### 3.4 Format of options.
Create the option as an object.

e.g.
`var options = {option_key:"value",...}`

### 4. Outputs and Customization

#### Default

#### Customizing outputs
You can however customize the outputs in two ways.

##### By fetching html 

##### By the parsed object

### 5 About
#### 5.1 Intention 
This generator is aimed at parsing single object Node.js app that exports some methods traceable from the root object. 

Doesn't work on browser-side js.

Tracing ES5 requires.

If your code has a tree structure that exports methods as branches, then this generator might be able to help you generate documents for your codes.

However, this generator only salvages comments of type "function", and ignores everything else.

#### 5.2 Enviroment
Developed on :
  - Node.js (v12.13.0)
  - Windows 10 (not really checking anything on any other OSes)

#### 5.3 Origin 
I've tried to use some document generators out there and couldn't have an expected output. 

I thought I did something wrong with system structure(single global object). But when I started simply dumping all required caches to console, I was seeing my app was fully loaded. 

Therefore I started making this app,by traversing the loaded caches of require calls.

This project was born.

## Roadmap
Everything should be ok by version 1.0.0.

If this project doesn't get updated, then that's a good news.

Anything else  might be of:
  1. Internationalization(translation)
  2. Bug fixes
  3. Presentation (homepage,typofix...)
  4. adopting to ES6
